## Project objective

To better understand the behavior of Citi Bike’s customer base (both one-time users and subscribers) and how they use Citi Bikes

This will help us to:

## Questions:

- What are the most popular pick-up locations across the city for Citi Bike rental?

- How does the average trip duration vary across different age groups?

- Which age group rents the most bikes?

- How does bike rental vary across the two user groups (one-time users vs long-term subscribers) on different days of the week? 

- Does the factor of user age impact the average bike trip duration?

## Summary & Findings

- Top 5 pick-up locations for bikes: 

  Grove St Path, Exchange Place, Sip Ave, Hamilton Park, & Morris Canal

- Customer base: 

  Based on your findings, how would you describe Citi Bike’s customer base? Think in terms of characteristics like age and user type

## Recommended actions:

1. Product recommendations:

  Install more bikes at Grove St Path, Sip Ave, Newport Path, Newark Ave, Van Vorst Park. 

2. Marketing recommendations:

The Citi Bike customer base is mostly long-term subscribers aged between 35-44,  who are most active during the week. This tells us that they are probably people who live in New York and use Citi Bikes to commute. Marketing and advertising campaigns should therefore target this particular demographic.
